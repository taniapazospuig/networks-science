## Network Science Practicum - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my deliverables for the **Introduction to Network Science** course, a second-year subject in the Bachelor's degree in *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. 

### About the Course

- **Instructor**: [Carlos Castillo](https://chato.cl/)  
- **Link to Course Materials**: [Network Science Course](https://github.com/chatox/networks-science-course/tree/master)

The deliverables in this repository correspond to the practicum exercises proposed in the **2023 edition** of the course. Note that practicum deliverables may vary across different course editions.

The course instructors provided the coding structure and commentary templates in each practical session to guide the exercises, and I have written my solutions based on this framework. Full course materials, including the original practicum structure, can be found in the official repository.
